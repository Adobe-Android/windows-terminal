## Installing and running Windows Terminal

> ðŸ‘‰ Note: Windows Terminal requires Windows 10 1903 (build 18362) or later

### Microsoft Store [Recommended]

Install the [Windows Terminal from the Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/terminal). This allows you to always be on the latest version when we release new builds with automatic upgrades.

This is the preferred method.

### Other install methods

#### Via Windows Package Manager CLI (aka winget)

[winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) users can download and install the latest Terminal release by installing the `Microsoft.WindowsTerminal` package:

```powershell
winget install --id=Microsoft.WindowsTerminal -e
```

#### Via Chocolatey (unofficial)

[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) users can download and install the latest Terminal release by installing the `microsoft-windows-terminal` package:

```powershell
choco install microsoft-windows-terminal
```

To upgrade Windows Terminal using Chocolatey, run the following:

```powershell
choco upgrade microsoft-windows-terminal
```

If you have any issues when installing/upgrading the package please go to the [Windows Terminal package page](https://chocolatey.org/packages/microsoft-windows-terminal) and follow the [Chocolatey triage process](https://chocolatey.org/docs/package-triage-process)
